## How to OpShrt
  
Go to [opshrt.art](https://opshrt.art/) or [opshrt.xyz](https://opshrt.xyz/) and focus on focusing.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOT IMPLEMENTED YET ‚ö†Ô∏è
~~There you will find two ways to buy an OpShrt:~~

 - ~~By auctions, paid in BTC~~
 - ~~By burning $shrt~~ 

~~*Special collections* inscriptions are *obfuscated* by high-complexity ******* protocol, and revealed only after purchase üëÄ~~

### How to redeem it ?
**wen shrt ?** üëï
In the website on the *redeem* tab, connect your wallet, chose the opshrt you want to **burn** and sign the transaction.

For your security, please **respect your own privacy** and *don't* fill your personal address.

## Ecosystem  

For now, OpShrts and $shrt are the only assets to focus on.

New drawing proposals will happen on twitter, stay tuned !

### **$shrt** is the native BRC20 of the OpShrt ecosystem.  
But it is not even us who deployed it lol

The total supply is 10m, max mint is 10k.
 We want the token to have a nice holder distribution.

When we reach 500 hodlers, OpShrts will be available to buy with $shrt.

Focus, $shrt usage will not be limited to buy OpShrts.
Focus, $shrt OpShrt collection will be tight.
